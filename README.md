#  Book Recommender System Using Machine Learning! | Collaborative Filtering Based

Suggestion frameworks are turning out to be progressively significant in the present very bustling world. Individuals are in every case in a rush with the bunch errands they need to achieve in the restricted 24 hours. In this manner, the suggestion frameworks are significant as they assist them with settling on the best decisions, without using their mental assets.

The reason for a proposal framework essentially is to look for content that would be fascinating to a person. Besides, it includes various elements to make customized arrangements of helpful and fascinating substance intended for every client/person. Proposal frameworks are Computerized reasoning based calculations that skim through every conceivable choice and make a redid rundown of things that are fascinating and pertinent to a person. These outcomes depend on their profile, search/perusing history, what others with comparative qualities/socioeconomics are watching, and how probably are you to watch those motion pictures. This is accomplished through prescient demonstrating and heuristics with the information accessible.

## Appendix

This is a streamlit web application that can recommend various kinds of similar books based on an user interest.

Appendix

The following materials are provided as supporting information for this project:

1. Data Source Information - A detailed description of the data sources used in this project, including their format, origin, and content. This could include information on the nature of the data such as the book titles, authors, genre, publishing date, and ratings.

2. Code Examples - Sample code snippets used in the project, demonstrating how different parts of the code were written and implemented. This may include examples of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training and prediction, and evaluation.

3. Evaluation Metrics - A detailed explanation of the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the book recommendation system. This could include metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and Mean Average Precision at K (MAP@K), and related calculations.

4. Data Pre-processing Methodology - A step-by-step process for data cleaning and pre-processing, including the methods used for outlier handling, missing data imputation, and feature engineering. This could also include information on how data normalization and transformation was performed.

5. Model Tuning and Selection - A description of the model selection process, including the hyperparameter tuning methodology and the rationale behind choosing a particular model. This may include information on different models used, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, and how the model was trained and optimized.

6. Results - A summary of the results obtained from the evaluation of the book recommendation system, including relevant plots, tables, and graphs. This could detail how well the recommendation system performed at predicting books that a user might be interested in, and how it compared to baselines and other models.

7. Limitations and Future Directions - A discussion of the limitations of the project, as well as potential future directions for improvements and extensions. This may include discussion of limitations in the data used, potential for introducing bias, or areas where the model may not perform well.

8. References - A list of references cited in the project, including research papers or articles used for background information, inspiration, or relevant code snippets.

## Deployment

Clone the repository


STEP 01- Create a conda environment after opening the repository


```bash
conda create -n books python=3.7.10 -y
```

```bash
conda activate books
```


STEP 02- install the requirements


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


```bash

#run this file to generate the models

Books Recommender.ipynb
```



Now run,
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
